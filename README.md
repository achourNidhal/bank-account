## Description
Bank account is an application that allows you to manage the operations of a bank account
- Deposit and Withdrawal
- Account statement (date, amount, balance)
- Statement printing
 
To keep the application as simple as possible, a static list of accounts is used (see accounts repository implementation), to be able to test the application,
only one of these accounts must be used.

As required, no frameword was used to implement this application.
